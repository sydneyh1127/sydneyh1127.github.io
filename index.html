<h2> "My name is Sydney Hunt and I just turned 16 about a month ago. I am the oldest of two children, having a little sister named Shelby who will be entering 7th grade this fall. I live in Salisbury Mills with my mom, dad, sister, and my dog Tootsie, whom is the love of my life. She is a 4 year old Morkie (Maltese and Yorkie mix) and I spoil her rotten. My friends like to call me a “mom”, because I am constantly caring for others and prepared for everything. I’m always carrying what I like to call “emergency items” like lunch money, snacks, chocolate, gum, pencils, Baind-Aids, water bottles, breakfast bars, Chapstick, lotion, deodorant, and much more. I am basically the kid version of Mrs. Hines, always having everything on me, no matter how weird it may be. I am probably known by most people for always being busy. In addition to taking all advanced classes, I play soccer and run indoor and outdoor track for the school, dance, volunteer, play piano, and participate in Key Club, Math Team, Quiz Bowl, Safe School Ambassadors and Foreign Affairs club. This summer I also am doing a Summer Immersion Program called Girls Who Code, where all day for seven weeks I will take the bus to the Microsoft Center in Times Square to learn how to code, learn about robotics, and be exposed to tech jobs, which will help with my interest in studying biomedical engineering. I am kind of a workaholic (or I guess schoolaholic) because I don’t have that much time to hang out and have fun with friends like most teenagers do. However, I have found ways to manage my schedule so I can both relax and work hard at the same time. In my opinion, my biggest strengths are being able to multitask, my corny jokes, and finding bargains. I think my biggest weaknesses are complacency and geography. If I had to describe myself, I would say that overall I am a selfless, active, and dependable overachiever who does not like being the center of attention. " </h1>
